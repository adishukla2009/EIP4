**1. Convolution**    
Convolution is way to traverse the image and output is generated on the element multiplication of the kernel and the dataset.  
  
**2. Filters/Kernels**  
Every image/dataset is basically made up of basic features (i.e. an image is made up of freatures like edges, gradients) and it's the responsibility of kernel to extract these features. A kernel is therefore also called feature extractor.  

**3. Epochs**  
An Epoch is termed as the traversal of whole dataset once. In our code for the network we have used 10 Epochs meaning the dataset of 60000 images was used 10 times for the purpose of training our neural network.
